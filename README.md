After that you can simply choose to name your device or accept the default name and finish. 

# **How to Use:**
After selecting your new device click the green arrow next to the device indicator this will start the app and device emulator.
If the phone is off simply press the power button in the top left of the window to turn on the phone.
Before you can run the app first you will need to add some images to your gallery to in order to use the app. Simply use the browser on the phone and search whatever image you want to use in google and download it to save it to your gallery for future use.

After you get some images we can now use the app. The first time you run the app it may ask for permission to access your storage. Press accept as this is how the app will be able to use the pictures you just downloaded. Next you will want to click the "Load Image from Gallery" button to open your gallery. Then select an image. Once you are taken back to the app and see your image simply click Identify and wait. Soon you should see what the model predicts your image is.
